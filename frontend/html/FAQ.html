            what is food re-serve waste?
            <p>
                Food Re-Serve is a food recovery and food waste management network that helps connect individuals and businesses with excess food to people in need. We approach the issue of hunger with a sharing-economy model: the donation of excess food enables a vital, yet often wasted, resource to be used to its full capacity.
                Food Re-Serve is an edible food Recovery Project which serves the surplus excess foods from Weddings , Parties , and other events, to the hungry and deprived. The contact details of the leftover food from our contributers
